The course As part of on-the-job training, I got the chance to take a really nice course on UDemy called &amp;lsquo;Ethical Hacking &amp;amp; Bug Hunting: Buffer Overflow For Beginners&amp;rsquo; by Eslam Medhat.
https://www.udemy.com/course/buffer-overflow-course-exploit-development/
It uses Kali and Windows VMs that communicate with eachother in order to perform DLL injection that leads to a reverse shell being opened.
As someone who has never exploited this vulnerability before, this course gave me an intimate look into exactly how these attacks occur and how to craft one from scratch, provided you have the binary of the exploitable program.</description></item></channel></rss>
