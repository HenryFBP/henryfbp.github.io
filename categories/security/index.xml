CLI is designed around dev workflows Not really designed for production docker-compose CLI talks to docker daemon and can be a substitute for the docker CLI itself docker-compose takes long-ass commands with 20+ flags and puts them into YAML files &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s not create more scripts, but make a tool that automates workflow in a declarative way&amp;rdquo; Use the docker-compose for dev&amp;rsquo;t but not for deployment, that should be done with docker command.</description></item><item><title>Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) Notes</title><link>/posts/2020-06-15-csslp-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-06-15-csslp-notes/</guid><description>Preamble https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CSSLP

The course As part of on-the-job training, I got the chance to take a really nice course on UDemy called &amp;lsquo;Ethical Hacking &amp;amp; Bug Hunting: Buffer Overflow For Beginners&amp;rsquo; by Eslam Medhat.
https://www.udemy.com/course/buffer-overflow-course-exploit-development/
It uses Kali and Windows VMs that communicate with eachother in order to perform DLL injection that leads to a reverse shell being opened.
As someone who has never exploited this vulnerability before, this course gave me an intimate look into exactly how these attacks occur and how to craft one from scratch, provided you have the binary of the exploitable program.</description></item></channel></rss>
