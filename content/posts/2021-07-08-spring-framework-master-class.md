## Section 1. Intro to Spring

What is Spring?

A: It's a Dependency Injection Framework.

What is DI?

What is a dependency??

### Dependency

Below, the web layer depends on the business layer. The business layer depends on the data layer. Etc.

![](/images/2021-07-08-spring-framework-master-class/layers.png)

Typical code may have a service that is tightly coupled with some implementation of an algorithm, i.e.:

```java
public class BusinessService{

    SortAlgo sortAlgo = new BubbleSortAlgo();
}
```

```java
public class BubbleSortAlgo implements SortAlgo {
    ...
}
```

This is tight coupling because the `BusinessService` class is tightly coupled with a specific implementation of a class, `BubbleSortAlgo`. 

We can make this code loosely coupled by removing instantiation of dependencies:

```java
public class BusinessService{

    SortAlgo sortAlgo;  // = new BubbleSortAlgo();

    public BusinessService(SortAlgo sa){
        this.sortAlgo=sa;
    }
}
```

Now the `BusinessService` class can use any `SortAlgo` class it wants.

...

Who does this? Where do you write this logic?

...

This is where Spring Framework comes in.

SF does this. It instantiates objects and populates their dependencies.

It's my/your job as a programmer to tell Spring Framework what objects it needs to manage and what the dependencies of each class are.

- How does Spring know to create an instance of `BubbleSortAlgo`?
- How does Spring know to create an instance of `BusinessService` and populate it with an instance of `BubbleSortAlgo`?

i.e; how does Spring know to do this:

```java
SortAlgo sa = new BubbleSortAlgo();

BusinessService bs = new BusinessService(sa);
```

given this code:

```java
public class BusinessService{

    SortAlgo sortAlgo;

    public BusinessService(SortAlgo sa){
        this.sortAlgo=sa;
    }
}
```

There are 2 annotations that tell Spring what objects it needs to manage and what are the dependencies of a class.

## `@Component` and `@Autowired`, what is Dependency Injection?

```java
@Component
public class BusinessService {

    @Autowired
    SortAlgo sortAlgo;
}
```

```java
@Component
public class BubbleSortAlgo implements SortAlgo {...}
```

We are telling Spring
> "You need to start managing instances of `BusinessService` and `BubbleSortAlgo`"

But how do we know that `SortAlgo` is a dependency of `BusinessService`?

We use another annotation: `@Autowired`.

`@Component` will make Spring start managing instances of that class.

`@Autowired` means Spring will start looking for a SF (Spring Framework) managed class to find a matching class for the `sortAlgo` variable. Internally, Spring will assign a `new BubbleSortAlgo()` to that `sortAlgo` variable, by passing it as an argument to the constructor to a `BusinessService` object.

This is called Dependency Injection. SF makes sure that all SF managed classes are created with dependencies properly populated.

### Terminology

- Beans
    - In the above java code, we are telling SF to manage `BusinessService` and its dependencies (`SortAlgo`) by using annotations. Those two instances that SF manages are called "Beans".

    - Beans are the different objects that are managed by SF.

- Autowiring
    - The process of SF 

- Dependency Injection
    - At a high level, the `@Autowired` annotation causing the `SortAlgo` object to be populated is DI.
    - We are declaring X as a dependency of Y, and X gets automatically filled in.

You may notice these are all kind of related. And all sinple.

- Inversion of Control
    - When we started off this example, we were explicitly assigning a value to the `sortAlgo` variable. The class `BusinessService` was responsible for creating an instance of the `SortAlgo`.
    - But when we use `@Autowired`, we delegate control of creating the dependency instance to Spring Framework. We're taking the control away from the class that wants a dependency, and giving it to SF. This is what IoC is.

- IOC Container
- Application Context
    - The most important IOC Container as far as Spring is concerned is the AC.
    - The AC creates and manages all of the beans
    - This is the most important part of SF.

### What is Spring?

Spring is a DI Framework!

## Section 2: Spring Master Class - Level 1 to Level 6 - Course Overview, Github & More

### Spring Framework Master Class - Overview

- <https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-master-class>
- [Course Guide PDF](/files/2021-07-08-spring-framework-master-class/SpringMasterClass-CourseGuidev0.1.pdf)

You learn the basics of SF in 6 levels. See Course Guide.

## Section 3: Spring Level 1 - Introduction to Spring Framework in 10 Steps

### Section Introduction - Spring Framework in 10 Steps

See <https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-master-class/tree/master/01-spring-in-depth> for code.

Use Eclipse Oxygen. (or intellij idea, i do)

### Spring Level 1, 2 and 3 - Github Folder

Also, use Spring Initializr with version 2.3.1. Do NOT use snapshot versions.

### Step 1 - Setting up a Spring Project using <http://start.spring.io>

Let's use <http://start.spring.io>.

Use default settings.

Open Eclipse and "Import Existing Maven Projects".

See <https://github.com/HenryFBP/Spring-Framework-Master-Class/tree/master/spring-in-5-steps> for pom.xml.

### Step 2 - Understanding Tight Coupling using the Binary Search Algorithm Example

See commit `57067849eacdd31b2fc6847eb0ebd064662e9bc2`.

### Step 3 - Making the Binary Search Algorithm Example Loosely Coupled

The solution to tight coupling is to use an Interface in Java.

See commit `b89076ee702e351a48e1f567fc552f14a6a79ad6`
