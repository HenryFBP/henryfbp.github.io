## Challenges of monolith apps

### Issues with monolith apps

- Slow to develop
- Tight coupling
- 1 failure causes entire app to fail most of the time
- Hard to decouple things if you want to extract functionality

### Microservice benefits

- Autonomous teams
- Small and independent services
- Diverse tech
- Resilience and duplication
- One module doesn't necessarily depend on another like in monolith apps
- Separate data repos
- Decomposes apps into a set of manageable services
- Don't need to be forced to use 1 technology, can be heterogenous
- Scalable separately
