-   The reason I left this job is simple. Private tutoring offered me better hours, better pay, and less stress.
    Frequently I would find myself tutoring for 4 hours at a time with around 5 people, and private tutoring was much less stressful than that.

  - My mom was terminally ill.

### Librarian/IT Contractor 
> Oak Bluffs Public Library, Massachusetts

-   After working for Oak Bluffs Public Library and replacing many of their old reference computers for a very low cost, I was commissioned by Falmouth Public Library to replicate this for FPL's aging reference computers.
-   This solution was to use the micro-computer known as the Raspberry Pi as a reference computer and configure it with a restricted desktop environment as well as strict web browsing settings, costing about $40 per unit and saving hundreds of dollars of the costs of buying an entire desktop.
-   In addition to cost savings, using a custom site blacklist meant absolute control over what sites patrons were allowed to visit (or not visit).
-   Day-to-day technological operations such as setting up/turning off PCs
-   Troubleshooting IT issues such as connection, computer operation, and printers.
-   Answering patrons' questions regarding printing, word processing software, phones, and all other technological questions.
-   Documenting procedures, protocols, and troubleshooting regarding the custom Raspberry Pi hardware solution.
-   The reason for this one-month employment is I was only visiting my relatives in Massachusetts, and decided to pick up a summer job. I did not expect to be doing contracting work, but it evolved into that after my IT skills were realized and applied by the library's director and word got around.

### Junior Engineer
